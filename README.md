# javascript-100

100 projects of Javascript to develop my skills.

# Description

My goal is to get a much better understanding of JavaScript building from (mostly) scratch as I can from projects I find around the internet. My goal is to complete all 100 before January 1, 2023.

# Coding Log

1. Day 1: Monday, Sept 26, 2022. I created a JS/CSS clock based on Wes Bos's clock. I altered background, height of the hour hand, thickness of the minute hand, and color of the second hand. I also added a digital time at the top, in case the clock is hard to read (or people forget how; analog clocks are hard).

# CREDITS/TUTORIALS

I will update this to reflect where I got my tutorials/project Ideas come from.
